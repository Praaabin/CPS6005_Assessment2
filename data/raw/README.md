⚠️ **IMPORTANT: CSV DATA FILE REQUIRED**

Before proceeding with Step 2 (Docker) and Step 3 (HDFS), you need to:

## Action Required:
1. **Download or locate** the file: `CPS6005-Assessment 2_GTFS_Data.csv`
2. **Place it in**: `c:\Users\prabi\OneDrive\Desktop\CPs6005\data\raw\`

## File Location:
The CSV file should be available from your Moodle course page as mentioned in the assignment brief.

## Once the file is in place:
- The file path should be: `c:\Users\prabi\OneDrive\Desktop\CPs6005\data\raw\CPS6005-Assessment 2_GTFS_Data.csv`
- Then we can proceed with starting Docker and uploading to HDFS

## Current Status:
❌ CSV file NOT found in `data/raw/`
✅ Docker Compose configuration updated and ready
✅ HDFS upload script ready

**Please add the CSV file, then I'll continue with Steps 2-11.**
